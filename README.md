# Crypto_investment_machine_learning_chal10
This is a python program that will allow users to use and visualize the outcome of machine learning data to better inform themselves. 
<br />

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 and jupyter notebook 

<br />


## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

pip install pandas
pip install hvplot
import path
pip install pyviz hvplot
pip install scikit-learn
<br />

## Findings/Analysis 

I started by preparing the data using standard scaler and created a new dataframe with the scaled data. Next, the value of k was found to determine what was the best number to use, this was found using the elbow plot. k was the modeled again, fitted, then segmented using the predict function. This data was then plotted to visually see the results. <br />

This process was then repeated with the PCA data to reduce the features and compare the results with the previous data.
